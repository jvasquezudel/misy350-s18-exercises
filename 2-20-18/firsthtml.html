      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>This is testing the paragraph function for html code and this is where
      the paragraph needs to break. There are other things that I can talk about
      when typing in this paragraph, but I will not continue.</p>

      <p>If you want to know more about html click <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="blank">here</a></p>

        <p>Here is a very basic tutorial for HTML</p>

        <h3>Classes</h3>
        <p>The class that I am doing this for is my MISY350 class. This is one
        of the first things that we are learning in this class. Of course there
        will be other programming languages that we will learn later on.</p>

      <h2>Other Progamming Languages</h2>
      <p>As mentioned before, I will learn other programming languages in this
        class as well. I will in a bit list the programming languages that we
        will learn. The proffesor mentioned that we may go into others, but that
         all depends on how much time is left later in the semester.</p>
