      <h2>About Classes</h2>
      <p>Now to go over what I will be taught in the other classes that I am
      currently taking. </p>

      <h3>MISY330</h3>
      <p>In the MISY330 we have so far learned about the way data structures
      work in concept. We have learned about cardinalities and business rules.
      Also how logical data models and entity relationship model is about how the
      client wants to set up their database.</p>

      <h3>ACCT327</h3>
      <p>In the ACCT327 we have so far learned differet cost methods. One of
      the first that we learned was Activity Based Costing, and that is about
      charging jobs based on the amount of work that is done. Another way of
      costing that we have learned is Process Costing and that is finding how
      much to charge when a job is still in the process  of being completed.</p>
